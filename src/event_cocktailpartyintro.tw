As you roll out of bed you can't help but have a good feeling about the day. The feeling puts a hop in your step as you shower and prepare to serve breakfast. Afterwards you decide to ride the wave and end up relaxing in your room for the rest of the morning instead of getting your chores done.

It's nice to spend the morning chilling out for once but you eventually remember you need to at least get the daily jobs done.

::firstcocktailparty1a [event]
 The main foyer is busy with people setting up for the party this evening. The Sono's spare no expense with lavish decoration, flowers arrangements. The smell coming from the kitchen is amazing. The rooms were already impressive before but now you can really see the money on display.
 
You dodge a few of the workers as they move through with another bouquet. One of the women moving through the room catches your eye. She is wearing a gorgeous maid's outfit that looks like something out of a boutique magazine
 
As you are busy taking in the sight of the cute maid when you get a shove from behind from two more people moving a table. The world teeters for a moment before you stumble down the stairs and run strait into a woman holding a stack of plates. You try to steady yourself but all you manage to do is tangle your feet in hers. Both you and the server crash to the ground and the plates shatter on impact.

[[This won't be good.|firstcocktailparty1b]]

::firstcocktailparty1b [event]
 
Everyone in the room turns to you both, lying on the ground and the caterer comes storming out of the kitchen.
 
<<= $caterer.speak("What the hell is this!?")>>
 
The woman tries to pick herself up but stumbles back to ground in pain with a twisted ankle.
 
The caterer grabs some ice in a towel and rushes over to her shouting at you. <<= $caterer.speak("You idiot!")>> The man immediately starts icing her ankle.
 
Everyone else is just watching and enjoying the drama unfold when $wife.name walks into the room.
 
<<= $wife.speak("Well, well. What's going on here?")>>
 
<<= $caterer.speak("Your clumsy little fool of a servant injured my best server. That's what!")>>
 
<<= $wife.speak("Oh please $caterer.name. Stop shouting.")>>
 
Some of the other people come a help the woman onto a seat. The sprain is already swelling up and the woman is clearly in pain. $caterer.name stands over you and confronts $wife.name.
 
<<= $caterer.speak("This is a problem. It's short notice and I'm without my server.")>> He starts pacing back and forth. <<= $caterer.speak("You don't hire me to work in conditions like this. That's it! I'm leaving.")>>
 
$caterer.name starts to walk away but $wife.name runs over and stops him.
 
<<= $wife.speak("Now $caterer.name just calm down. Do you have any idea how hard it will be to get someone to cover this evening? You're the best caterer in the city.")>>
 
<<= $caterer.speak("Well do you expect me to serve myself? I need someone to help who knows what they are doing.")>>
 
$wife.name looks down at you and then back to $caterer.name. <<= $wife.speak("I'll get you a replacement alright? Just keep doing your usual, brilliant work and I'll be back.")>>
 
$wife.name grabs your arm and pulls you to your feet with startling ease and shoves you out of the room.
 
<<= $caterer.speak("It better be fast and they'd better know what they are doing!")>> $caterer.name shouts down the hall.
 
$wife.name drags you towards the [[Master Bedroom|firstcocktailparty2]]
<<set $flags.firstCocktailParty to true>>

::firstcocktailparty2 [event] 
<<= $wife.speak("I swear $caterer.name is such a handful some times.")>> $wife.name pushes you down onto the bed so you're sitting on the end with her towering over you. "This is a disaster. Do you know how much trouble you've caused with your little stunt?")>>
 
<<= $player.speak("But the workers…")>>
 
<<= $wife.speak("Never mind that. $caterer.name is the best caterer in the city and I will not have sub-standard serving at my party tonight. It's too late to hire someone else who has any real skill and since you caused this mess I'm holding responsible. You're still in under probation so you know what this means? You forfeit the terms of your service and you'll be shipped off to a labour camp.")>>
 
<<= $player.speak("But it wasn't me! I got shoved.")>> Your heart is thrumming in your chest at the mention of the camps. From the few stories you've heard about them over the last week they're pretty severe with gangs and cruel guards that treat their charges like cattle.
 
<<= $wife.speak("I don't want to hear your weak excuses.")>> You never realised you could feel this small but $wife.name was holding all the cards. <<= $wife.speak("The only solution is that you take over serving duties at the party tonight. I was originally going to hide you away but this will have to do. I couldn't have someone in your state around our guests. If you agree and do a good job I'll pretend this whole mess never happened. What do you say? It's either this or I hand you over to the state.")>>
 
[[Agree to serve at the party. It's the only real option you have.|firstcocktailparty3a]]

::firstcocktailparty3a [event] 
<<= $wife.speak("Excellent. Not that you have much choice though. Who knows, if you like it we might make this part of your normal duties. Now we can't have you dressed like this so stay there while I get you something to wear.")>>
 
$wife.name goes into the closet and you sit wringing your hands nervously. Hopefully you can do well enough that they'll let you stay on at the estate.
 
She comes back out with a bundle of items and starts laying them out on the large master bed. There's some simple silk bra and panties, a nice black and white silk dress…

[img[setup.ImagePath + "events/cocktailparty/clothes01.jpg"]]

<<= $player.speak("<i>What the fuck?</i>")>>
 
<<= $player.speak("What the hell? Why are you getting out women's clothes.")>>
 
$wife.name snaps around and stares right at you. <<= $wife.speak("Watch your tone.")>>
 
You immediately shrink back realising how that sounded and she [[continues.|firstcocktailparty3b]]

::firstcocktailparty3b [event]
 
$wife.name continues putting out the clothes she had gathered. <<= $wife.speak("There is a guest coming tonight who is a valued business partner and friend of the family. He is quite vocal in his distaste of keeping male indentured servants. That means if this is going to work you will need to pretend to be a girl for the night. I will ''NOT'' tolerate him finding out you are a boy. It shouldn't be too hard for you to pass as a girl anyway.")>>
 
Then under her breathe you hear her say. <<= $wife.speak("Who knows, you might enjoy playing the part.")>>
 
<<= $wife.speak("Now you're a more slight than I would like. Strip down and put the underwear on so I can see if they fit.")>>
 
<<= $player.speak("Can't I at least wear my own underwear?")>>
 
<<= $wife.speak("Oh for goodness sake. If you're going to convince anyone you need to wear everything. If you're that embarrassed by your manhood you can go into the bathroom.")>>
 
[[Go to bathroom|firstcocktailparty4]]

::firstcocktailparty4 [event] 
You reach out take the black silk panties, half worried they might jump up and bite you. $wife.name bustles you into the large bathroom that ajoins the closet.
 
Once the door is safely closed you. You drop your shirt, pants and boxers onto a nearby counter and hold out the girly panties.
 
<<= $player.speak("<i>Geez, my heart is pounding.</i>")>>
 
You hold the black silk down and then step one foot in and then then other before pulling them up your legs.

[img[setup.ImagePath + "events/cocktailparty/pantiesup.jpg"]]

The feel of the material against your skin is nice and almost tingles. It's a way different feeling from your boring cotton boxers. You snap the waist band over your hips and adjust the edges so they aren't pulling or riding up everywhere and examine the fit.
 
The black silk cups and conceals your manhood but it’s a bit tight since they are clearly made for someone with less down there. They're not really uncomfortable though and the feeling of the silk against your sensitive member is much more acute. You twist slightly and your penis almost pokes out one side of the crotch before slipping back in.
 
As you are twisting and turning the bathroom door suddenly opens and $wife.name comes in with the rest of the lingerie.
 
You rush to cover yourself. <<= $player.speak("I thought you were waiting outside!?")>>

$wife.name puts the items on top of your normal clothes. <<= $wife.speak("We need those legs smooth as silk. Sit down.")>> She grabs you by the shoulders again and sits you down on the ornate chaise lounge near the vanity.
 
<<= $player.speak("But the stockings aren't even see through.")>>

<<= $wife.speak("Shush now.")>>

[[She's setting the terms so you have no choice|firstcocktailparty5a]]

::firstcocktailparty5a [event] 
$wife.name pulls out a razor and some shaving butter. She starts rubbing the oil all over your leg.
 
<<= $wife.speak("Hmm. It's nice a sparse already. Convenient.")>>
 
She then begins softly running the razor in lines down your thigh. The feel of her hands rubbing oil over your legs and now the razor is definitely having an effect on other parts of your body. You try to shift your seat to make room for your growing arousal.
 
$wife.name stops and then - ''WHACK'' - She gives you a hard slap on your butt.
 
<<= $player.speak("Ouch!")>> Your shout was far less deep than you would've liked.
 
<<= $wife.speak("Don't move. I don't want to nick you.")>>
 
You stop shifting as she removes all the hair from first one leg and then the other. She gets you to roll over so she can do the backs and your growing erection is uncomfortably squished against the chaise.
 
<<= $wife.speak("All done for the legs.")>>

[img[setup.ImagePath + "player/legs/legs_smooth_02.jpg"]]

<<= $wife.speak("Now roll over and lay down.")>>

[[Roll over.|firstcocktailparty5b]]

:: firstcocktailparty5b [event] 
You roll over and she repeats the process on the thin patch of hair on your chest.
 
<<= $player.speak("<i>Who will even see my chest?</i>")>>
 
[img[setup.ImagePath + "player/chest/chest_flat_02.jpg"]]

<<= $wife.speak("At least there's not much on your face. I think we'll leave that for now. Up you get.")>> She gives you another hard slap on the side of your butt and gets you to stand up.
 
<<= $wife.speak("Well then, on with the rest.")>> She gestures to the rest of the lingerie.
 
You look at the intimidating pile of silk beforing reaching out to take...

			You reach out and take the bra from the pile. It's a bit difficult to manage and you fumble a bit as you try to hook your arms through the loops. $wife.name is already tapping her foot impatiently. By the time you manage to get it over your shoulder they are already a bit tangled.<br>

$wife.name takes one the bigger items.

<<= $wife.speak("First the body shaper. Lift your arms up.")>>

You hold your arms above your head as she wraps the black lace around your waist and hips. You feel her tugging it tight as she hooks it together. It's very tight and you can already feel it compress your midsection.

::firstcocktailparty7 [event]

You take a deep breathe and $wife.name pulls the shaper even tighter and manages to get the hooks into the last holes.<br>

<<= $wife.speak("You can put your arms down now.")>>

You do and can feel the shaper holding your thin waist in tightly. You twist and bend a bit. It doesn't restrict your movement too much, if anything it's making you slouch less and hold yourself straighter. It's just really tight.

<<= $wife.speak("Bra next.")>>

[[Continue dressing|firstcocktailparty8]]

::firstcocktailparty8 [event]

$wife.name holds the shoulder straps for the bra open and you slip your hands through. She pulls it up over your shoulders before adjusting the fit on your chest. Once it's in the right place she hooks it together and walks back in front of you.
 
The cups of the bra sit flat and empty against your chest.
 
<<= $player.speak("I don't really need this do I?")>>
 
<<= $wife.speak("Yes.")>> She taps her chin and thinks for a moment. <<= $wife.speak("But your curves do need some work. Wait here.")>>
 
$wife.name goes back into the wardrobe leaving you in the bathroom. Your reach between your legs and adjust the black panties to give your growing erection a bit more space to move.
 
<<= $player.speak("<i>Stupid thing has mind of its own. There's no way this is turning me on.</i>")>>
 
It doesn't take long for $wife.name to returns holding two fleshy coloured bags. Without pausing she holds open one cup of the bra and pushes the squishy sack in and then does the same with the other cup. They're both cold against your chest and they're rubbing against your nipples. You can feel them already starting to perk up and making the rubbing even more noticeable.
 
$wife.name pulls your attention away from the breast forms as she grabs your chin and turns your face to the side.
 
<<= $wife.speak("Hmm, not a bad start but we'll need to work on your looks.")>>
 
[[She sits you down on the vanity chair.|firstcocktailparty9]]

::firstcocktailparty9 [event] 
<<= $wife.speak("Close your eyes.")>>

You do and feel her brushing and pushing against your face. It doesn't take a genius to guess that's she applying makeup.

[img[setup.ImagePath + "events/bath_routine/makeup_eyes01.gif"]]

It takes a few minutes and $wife.name chides you a few times for moving and spoiling her work. You can't help but feel like a child getting dressed up by their mother. In any other situation there's no way you would be letting this happen.

[img[setup.ImagePath + "events/bath_routine/makeup_lips01.gif"]]
 
She stops for a moment and you're tempted to open your eyes and risk getting a talking to.

Standing in front of you, wearing demure black lingerie, is one of the prettiest girls you've ever seen. Her slim legs look amazing with the black stocking hugging them and the body shaper is squeezing her waist just tight enough to  give a hint of curves to her narrow hips. The lacey bra hides away her small breasts as if encouraging someone to unwrap them. Her face has subtle make up done, with smoky eye shadow, glossy lips and a hint of blush giving her cheeks a hint of pink on her pale skin. The $player.hairColor chin length bangs makes her face pop even more and the ponytail begs someone to caress her thin neck.
 
Only problem is, that girl is you.

You reach up and cup your "breasts" through the silk bra. The breast forms give a little bit of weight to them but any sort of closer inspection would quickly reveal the truth. You suspect that's why $wife.name chose this bra, to make them feel real but have them hidden. As your knead teh faux breasts your nipples tingle as the texture gently pulls and twists them around.

The black skirt ends just above your knees and has a ruffled white petti coat underneath it to give a bit of bounce. The dress stops just below your bra but it includes a thin white blouse that covers them high enough to hide your assets. The effect enhances your new bust while still mostly hiding it from view. $wife.name has already tied a white apron over the skirt with a large white bow in the back. The puffy black sleeves go just over your shoulders and end in white lace.
 
There is a pair of black mary janes waiting and $wife.name buckles them up after helping you into them. Lastly she places a white lace bonnet on your head.
 
You turn and look in one of the full length mirror. The cute girl you saw earlier is still watching you only now in a little maids outfit. Overall the look is quite modest but just sexy enough that you're going to turn some heads. The appeal is there though and you wouldn't be surprised to see the outfit in a high class porno.

[img[setup.ImagePath + "events/cocktailparty/maid_debut.gif"]]

You follow after $butler.name and try to get used to the changes in your wardrobe. The shaper isn't uncomfortable but both it and the short heels are forcing you walk with a feminine sway. Feeling the air against your thighs makes you all to aware of the skirt you have on. You figet with your hands as the long ponytail tickles between your shoulders. Before you come into view of anyone else you reach down and shift uncomfortably a few times. After checking yourself out in the mirror your tapped member is already straining against it's restricting plastic prison.

$wife.name is already back in the kitchen with $caterer.name
 
<<= $wife.speak("Well $caterer.name. This is $player.femName.")>>
 
$caterer.name walks over to you and walks around you thoughtfully. You're reminded of when you met $wife.name for the first time as he examines you.

He loads the tray with some plastic and metal utensils he's not using and then you set about walking back and forth around the open space in the kitchen sitting room. It's a little hard a first and you drop everything a few times. The first time you dropped something you tried to bend down normally but the skirt started to ride up as you spread your knees. Instead you have to keep your legs together and kneel to the side to stop anyone from seeing the silk panties hiding your caged member. You catch a few of the workers stopping to stare when you do this and realise it’s a very delicate and lady like pose. When you stand back up you feel your crotch twitch uncomfortably against its restraints.
 
<<= $player.speak("It's just my blood pumping from being so nervous.")>>
 
After a while you seem to be getting the hang of it and $caterer.name calls you back over.
 
<<= $caterer.speak("Alright girl. One of the most important things to know about standing service is to watch the body language of your betters.")>>

<<= $player.speak("My name is ... $player.femName.")>>
 
<<= $caterer.speak("The position of the hands can tell you…")>> $caterer.name continues his in-depth explanation.
 
<<= $player.speak("Great. He's not even listening to me.")>>
 
As you're watching him explain the ins and outs of body language in relation to food service it clicks that even the voice in your head sounds bit feminine. You wonder what was in that drink $wife.name gave you.
 
After the lesson he has you do some basic tidy work while he finishes his prep. It's already starting to get to mid-afternoon. The workers have finished their setup and cleared out.

[[Your work continues into the afternoon.|firstcocktailparty21b]]

You're busy polishing the silver wear when $daughter.name comes into the kitchen already dressed for the party. She's wearing sexy black cocktail dress with back heels.

She pulls away and gives you a wink. You feel your cheeks burning and your penis quickly starts straining against its plastic prison.

$daughter.name gives you a quick pat on the cheek before turning around to $caterer.name. She walks over and they hug before a quick peck on each cheek.

<<= $caterer.speak("Good to have you back $daughter.name. These gatherings have been getting a bit stale.")>> $caterer.name's attitude is polar shift from when he's been talking to you or $wife.name.

<<= $daughter.speak("I have a feeling things might liven up over the next few weeks.")>> $daughter.name gives him another quick hug and moves to leave as guests start arriving.

<<= $caterer.speak("Come on girl. You're up.")>> $caterer.name pushes a tray forward and you quickly take it and leave to start serving the new arrivals.

[[Begin serving|cocktailparty_start]]

::firstcocktailparty23 [event]

Exhausted from the busy night your only thoughts are bathroom then bed. <<if $suitorPath is true>>Although the kiss still lingers on your mind.<</if>>

You head to the bathroom and quickly do a double take at the attractive maid looking at you before once again realising that you are the maid.

<<= $player.speak("What have I gotten myself into?")>> The cute girl says to you.
 
[[Undress|firstcocktailparty24]]

::firstcocktailparty24 [event]

You reach around to unzip the dress. It's a bit difficult since the zipper is fairly high but eventually, and after a lot of stretching and curses, you manage to grab a hold of it and pull the dress down off your shoulder and down to your ankles.

Following the reverse of what $wife.name did you remove the rest of the items, making sure to pile them neatly after her warning when you were getting dressed.

As you do you realise you haven't been to the bathroom all night and starting to feel the pressure on your bladder. You hurriedly pull down the panties and for first time see your penis trapped in the pink chastity cage.

[img[setup.ImagePath + "items/wearables/toys/cage_01.jpg"]]

<<= $player.speak("Pink. Really?")>>

You try to release the device but quickly find a small padlock holding the clasp shut.

<<= $player.speak("What the fuck!")>>

You tug and pull but only manage to make your urgent need to pee even worse.

[[Go ask for it to be unlocked.|firstcocktailparty25]]
[[It's late so you should wait until tomorrow.|firstcocktailparty26]]

::firstcocktailparty25 [event]

You head back through the halls of the estate. Compared to a few hours ago it's is practically dead. You reach the master bedroom but before knock on the door you hear noise from inside. You listen for a moment and it's clear $wife.title is preoccupied with her pending orgasm. You think better of it and head back to your room, resigned to spend the night in chastity.

[[Head back to your your bathroom.|firstcocktailparty26]]

::firstcocktailparty26 [event]

Resigning yourself to the situation you try to position yourself over the toilet to relieve yourself. It's a tight squeeze in the small room and you can't quite get your trapped member in the right spot. With a grumble you put the toilet seat down and turn around before planting your butt. You let go with a sigh of relief.

After a moment you catch sight of the cute $player.hairColor sitting on the loo in front of you. Your cheeks flush with embarrassment as you realise that if anyone saw this they would just think it was a flat chested girl peeing right now.

You wipe the cage clean with some tissue and then remove the wig and make up. You put the maid's clothes in the laundry to clean overnight before rolling in to bed to try and get some sleep.

[[sleep]]

::firstcocktailparty27 [event]

You look at the time and hope $wife.title is awake. You put on your normal clothes, grab the maid's uniform and head the master bedroom. After listening for the sound of any... morning activities you think it's clear so knock and wait for a moment and $wife.title eventually open the door.

<<= $wife.speak("What is it?")>> She seems awake enough so you think you timed it right.

<<= $player.speak("The uniform $wife.title.")>> You hold out the black and white bundle.

<<= $wife.speak("Of course.")>> She takes it and starts closing the door.

<<= $player.speak("Um, $wife.title.")>>

<<= $wife.speak("What?")>> She stops and is now a little frustrated.

<<= $player.speak("Would you mind, um, unlocking me.")>> Your eyes dart down to your crotch.

<<= $wife.speak("Oh, I suppose. We'll need to discuss your performance last night first.")>> She opens the door all the way and let you into her room.

You can see $owner.title lying asleep face down, clearly naked, and quickly follow $wife.title into the wardrobe.
